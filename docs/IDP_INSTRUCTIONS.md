# Identity Provider (IdP) Configuration Guides

Because this package uses OneLogin's [SAML2 PHP toolkit](https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/php-saml), it will
support almost any SAML2-compliant Identity Provider. The pages below are guides for configuring specific
IdPs. These are written and maintained by community members and therefor are not guaranteed to be accurate or
up-to-date. If you have a guide for an IdP that is not listed here, please consider contributing it to the
repository by opening a pull request!
